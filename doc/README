SingularWS
----------

This simple webservice is created for mathematics software that requires
outsourced computations mainly in ideal theory and commutative algebra.

To install it, you need an Apache server with PHP enabled, and Singular
must also be installed and available on the command path. The most
convenient way is to set up a Debian/Ubuntu server and install
the following pieces of software:

* libapache2-mod-php5
* singular

Then copy all files into /var/www as root and chmod 1777 /var/www/cache.

This software is intended to run on a standalone machine, preferably
on a virtual host.
