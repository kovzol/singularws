SingularWS
==========

1. About
--------

This simple webservice is created for mathematics software that requires
outsourced computations, mainly in ideal theory and commutative algebra.

To install it, you need an Apache server with PHP enabled, and Singular
must also be installed and available on the command path. The most
convenient way is to set up a Debian/Ubuntu server and install
the following pieces of software:

* libapache2-mod-php5
* singular

Then copy all files into /var/www as root and chmod 1777 /var/www/cache.

This software is intended to run on a standalone machine, preferably
on a virtual host.

2. Hints for production use
---------------------------

Since requests can be the same for different uses in many situations
(e.g. classroom use with several users, repeatition of a set of
problems), it is considerable to use a caching mechanism in front of the
web server. There are several ways to solve this, e.g. the mod_cache and
mod_disk_cache modules in Apache, or the Varnish accelerator. Due to its
stability, we recommend to use Varnish with the following settings:

* Change the Apache port from 80 to 8080 everywhere in its config files
  under the /etc/apache2 directory.
* Configure Varnish to listen on port 80 in /etc/default/varnish.
* Configure Varnish to use 127.0.0.1:8080 for the backend host in
  the /etc/varnish/default.vcl file.
* Restart the Apache and the Varnish services.

2.1. Downloading a virtual machine
----------------------------------

Many people just want to use SingularWS, but not to play with the
installation and configuration details. To ease their life, the GeoGebra
Team provides a VirtualBox virtual appliance to download at
http://geogebra2.idm.jku.at. After downloading it (that is a zipped .vdi
file), please start VirtualBox and load the appliance file, then start
the virtual machine. You can learn more on this here:
http://hacktolive.org/wiki/Using_VirtualBox_images_(.vdi_files) --- for
OS you could select Linux, Ubuntu (64 bit), the suggested memory is at
least 1 GB (for the very start 512 MB is also enough). Before starting
the machine it is important to change the network settings. You may
certainly want to enable the network interface to a bridged card to make
it possible for other machines to reach SingularWS from your local
network (intranet).

It is suggested to change the password for the singularws user (password
is the same as the username) when logging in at the first time. Remote
SSH login is also available. An experienced system administrator may
want to add extra safety by setting up a sophisticated firewall, for
example.

It is crucial to find out the IP address of your freshly started virtual
machine. After logging in, this can be achieved by running the
"ifconfig" command. (Another possibility is to check the network traffic
log on your router, if it is capable of this.) Then you can point your
browser to the IP of the virtual machine, e.g.:

http://192.168.1.102

Such a request should return the "e1" output (which means error code 1:
no command defined or no such command).

Please note that the virtual machine will be automatically set to obtain
a DHCP address from the same network as the host machine obtains its own
IP address from. To change or fine tune this behavior please consult the
VirtualBox documentation, the handbook of your router, and/or your
network administrator.

A demo virtual server can (hopefully) always be available at the
following URL:

http://geogebra2.idm.jku.at:8085

(Here 8085 is a special port we use at GeoGebra. For your virtual machine
it must not be entered, since the default port 80 will be used.)


3. Using SingularWS
-------------------

SingularWS can be used via its application programming interface (API)
which is defined in inc/commands.php. Basically, the most typical use
is to send the calculation request via an HTTP URL by setting the GET
parameters as needed.

Here are some simple examples:

* http://geogebra2.idm.jku.at:8085/?c=t
* http://geogebra2.idm.jku.at:8085/?c=s&p=12345*54321;
* http://geogebra2.idm.jku.at:8085/?c=s&p=123-45;67%2B8;
* http://geogebra2.idm.jku.at:8085/?c=s&p=ring%20r=0,(x,y),dp;ideal%20I=x^2,x;groebner(I)

The first example is a simple connection test, it should return "ok".
The second one simply multiplies two numbers---note the semicolon at the
end to ensure a nice output ("670592745 >", here the "greater than" sign
is the Singular prompt). The third one is a substraction and an
addition---note that "%2B" must be used instead of "+" (since "+" is
always converted to a space character). If you plan to use SingularWS
from a computer program you write, consider using an URL encoder
subroutine (e.g. urlencode in PHP, encodeURL in Java or quote_plus
in Python's urllib).

The fourth example shows the programming capabilities of Singular. It
calculates the Groebner basis of an ideal which consists of the
polynomials x^2 and x. (In any URL the space character can also be used,
but after serving the request, the web browser usually converts all
spaces into "%20" strings. Here in the example we used "%20" as an
input, too, for emphasizing that the URL is one text, not two ones.) The
calculation is done in R[x,y], and the ordering is "dp" which stands for
the reversed graduated lexicographical ordering. For more details please
consult the Singular documentation.

By default, calculation limit is set to the timeout of 30 seconds.
This can be fine tuned in inc/conf.php.

Since SingularWS can only work with GET requests currently, a length
limit for the command can be expected. E.g. Internet Explorer users will
be unable to send Singular program codes longer than about 2000 bytes.

3.1. The SingularWS API
-----------------------

In the present state of SingularWS just a very limited set of commands
are available, namely:

* c=t (command: connection test)
* c=s (command: Singular direct call) p=...

In the future some other commands may be added.

3.2 Example use in GeoGebra
---------------------------

At the moment this is in very experimental state, but one can find the
current source code at
http://dev.geogebra.org/trac/browser/trunk/geogebra/common/src/geogebra/common/cas/singularws/SingularWebService.java.

some testing on SingularWS.
